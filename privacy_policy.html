            <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same
              person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us
              to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously
              provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to
              provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the
              information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g.
              phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification
              methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>
            <p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or
              authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional
              information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your
              identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
              additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or
              fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we
